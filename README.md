This profiled path generator plots FTC (First Tech Challenge) waypoints and optimizes paths between them using cubic-spline interpolation. <br/>
The algorithim then converts the spline into discrete waypoints the robot can follow, which when used in conjunction with a geometric controller can improve FTC auton reliability.
